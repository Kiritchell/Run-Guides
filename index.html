      <h1 class="title">West Texas Runs</h1>
      <p class="info">
        There have been many sites that you go on to search for possible runs
        especially when you're newer to running. In my experience most of these
        have inadequate information or are runs that I'm not looking for.
        <br /><br />
        The goal for this site is to be a resource for new and seasoned runners
        to see what kind of runs are out there (specifically West Texas for now)
        and to get real information about the runs. <br />

              This is one of my favorite runs because of how much the scenery
              changes and it has very low traffic. Plus you run by multiple
              bodies of water and have a good bit of shade through parks!

              <b>Elevation change:</b> 700' <br />
              <b>Major road crossings</b> 3 | University at Buddy Holly, Erskine
              at Canyon Lake 2, Broadway at Mackenzie Park, MLK at Dunbar.
              <br />
              <b>Run Terrain</b> The majority of the run can be done in the
              street on the park road. Between Aztlan Park and Buddy Holly Park
              will be a sidewalk or paved trail you can run on. The roads are
              minimally trafficed no matter time of day.<br />
              <b>Tips</b> If you park your car at the red parking icon in
              Mackenzie Park you will be in the middle of the two loops so you
              can run either direction first and then pit stop at your car
              before continuing. <br />

              Want a challenging run? This one puts both mind & body to the test
              because of the straight roads and then very steep hills out of the
              canyon.

              <br />
              <b>Run Terrain</b> The entirety of the run is on the road. When on
              the CR you will have at least a 6' shoulder between the lane and
              the dirt and the pavement was in good shape. Since it was
              relatively light on traffic I ran in the lane of opposing traffic
              for level ground.<br />
              <b>Tips</b> I parked at the very top of the hill so I could start
              on level ground. When you go down into the canyon you'll notice
              that you're on a stupid steep hill and yes, you'll have to run
              back up it so be ready. If you have to walk it doesn't mean you
              failed. I <br />
