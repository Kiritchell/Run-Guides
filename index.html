    <h1 class="center">West Texas Runs</h1>
    <p class="center">There have been many sites that you go on to search for possible runs especially when you're newer to running. In my experience most of these have inadequate information or are runs that I'm not looking for. <br> The goal for this site is to be a resource for new and seasoned runners to see what kind of runs are out there (specifically West Texas for now) and to get real information about the runs. Through our detailed guides we want to answer questions like: <br> <br>1. How busy is the road?</br><br>2. How much running space is there for me?</br><br>3. Is it very scenic? Or what will I be able to look at?</br>
